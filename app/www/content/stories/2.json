        "Today, Gopi and Priya are going to the zoo! It is a beautiful, sunny day to visit all of the animals. As they hop out of the car, Gopi's dad asks them, \"What are you most excited to see?\"",
        "Priya yells, \"Tigers, of course!\" This makes Gopi laugh. Priya loves tigers because her pet cat is orange with stripes just like a small tiger.",
        "\"What are you most excited to see today, Gopi?\" His father asks. ",
        "Gopi thinks about the book they read in class about elephants and exclaims, \"I'm excited to see how elephants pick up their food with their trunks!\" As they wait in line to get their tickets, they hear a loud roar.",
        "\"That must be the lions,\" Gopi's dad says. They look around for the lions, but the first animals they see are the giraffes.",
        "\"Their necks are so long!\" Priya exclaims. The giraffes are able to reach and eat leaves from the tallest of trees. Gopi's tummy starts to grumble. \"I'm so hungry I think I am starting to sound like an animal!\" Gopi makes his way over to the canteen. There, Gopi grabbed some hot samosas and veggie puffs for his dad, Priya and himself. They quickly eat their samosas and run to the next exhibit!",
        "They see snakes and lizards. Priya runs by this exhibit because she doesn't like reptiles. Gopi follows her, mocking her for being so scared. Next, Gopi tries to stand on one leg while watching the flamingos, but almost falls over, making Priya laugh. ",
        "\"I wonder why flamingos are pink?\" Gopi wonders.",
        "\"They turn pink because they eat a lot of shrimp!\" Priya replies. Once they finish looking at all of the fish in the aquarium, it is time to go home. It has been a great day visiting the zoo!"
