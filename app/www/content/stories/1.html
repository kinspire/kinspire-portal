It is Gopi's first day at school and he is very 
<span class="stories-vocab">
	<span class="stories-vocab-word">nervous</span>	<div class="stories-vocab-def">Definition</div></span> about meeting his new classmates. As the bell rings at 8:30am he takes a long 
<span class="stories-vocab">
	<span class="stories-vocab-word">breath</span>	<div class="stories-vocab-def">Definition</div></span> and steps into homeroom, his first class, with 70 new faces looking at him - these will be his new classmates for the rest of the school year. The teacher, Mrs. Potts, welcomes Gopi with a 
<span class="stories-vocab">
	<span class="stories-vocab-word">bright</span>	<div class="stories-vocab-def">Definition</div></span> smile and asks him to 
<span class="stories-vocab">
	<span class="stories-vocab-word">introduce</span>	<div class="stories-vocab-def">Definition</div></span> himself to the rest of the class.
<br/><br/>"Hi, my name is Gopi and I love reading books. It's nice to meet you all!" says Gopi. Everyone is then rushed into a great big hall for assembly where the headmaster introduces the goals for the 
<span class="stories-vocab">
	<span class="stories-vocab-word">academic</span>	<div class="stories-vocab-def">Definition</div></span> year. Gopi has a 
<span class="stories-vocab">
	<span class="stories-vocab-word">difficult</span>	<div class="stories-vocab-def">Definition</div></span> time understanding all of these goals. He then begins to try to make friends with the girl beside him, Priya, but gets 
<span class="stories-vocab">
	<span class="stories-vocab-word">scolded</span>	<div class="stories-vocab-def">Definition</div></span> by his teacher because talking during the assembly is 
<span class="stories-vocab">
	<span class="stories-vocab-word">against</span>	<div class="stories-vocab-def">Definition</div></span> the rules. During the day Gopi attends many classes. He has English, History, Art, Science, Geography, which he mostly 
<span class="stories-vocab">
	<span class="stories-vocab-word">yawns</span>	<div class="stories-vocab-def">Definition</div></span> through, and Mathematics, which Gopi 
<span class="stories-vocab">
	<span class="stories-vocab-word">decides</span>	<div class="stories-vocab-def">Definition</div></span> will be his favorite subject because he loves adding and subtracting numbers! The last class of the day is Sports, where all the boys and girls have to do very tough exercises. At 3pm, Gopi is ready to eat the 
<span class="stories-vocab">
	<span class="stories-vocab-word">delicious</span>	<div class="stories-vocab-def">Definition</div></span> meal his mother packed him. He had a very 
<span class="stories-vocab">
	<span class="stories-vocab-word">adventurous</span>	<div class="stories-vocab-def">Definition</div></span> first day at school, made some new friends, and learned a lot, but most 
<span class="stories-vocab">
	<span class="stories-vocab-word">importantly</span>	<div class="stories-vocab-def">Definition</div></span>, he learned to never yawn when your 
<span class="stories-vocab">
	<span class="stories-vocab-word">coach</span>	<div class="stories-vocab-def">Definition</div></span> asks you your name because it will be 
<span class="stories-vocab">
	<span class="stories-vocab-word">followed</span>	<div class="stories-vocab-def">Definition</div></span> by 10 push ups every day of the week!
<br/><br/>When he comes to school the next day, Gopi is given a seat right 
<span class="stories-vocab">
	<span class="stories-vocab-word">beside</span>	<div class="stories-vocab-def">Definition</div></span> Priya, the new friend he met on the first day of school. In Art class, Priya and Gopi 
<span class="stories-vocab">
	<span class="stories-vocab-word">concentrate</span>	<div class="stories-vocab-def">Definition</div></span> on all the new things they are learning, like the names of shapes, colors, and how to paint! During Sports, however, after doing his 10 push ups as a punishment from the day before, Gopi cannot find Priya anywhere. He looks for her all over the 
<span class="stories-vocab">
	<span class="stories-vocab-word">huge</span>	<div class="stories-vocab-def">Definition</div></span> sports field. Everyone is in their sports uniforms and look so 
<span class="stories-vocab">
	<span class="stories-vocab-word">similar</span>	<div class="stories-vocab-def">Definition</div></span> that Gopi cannot find Priya in the crowd.
<br/><br/>After a few minutes, he hears someone crying near the locker rooms and sees that it is Priya. Her uniform is 
<span class="stories-vocab">
	<span class="stories-vocab-word">soiled</span>	<div class="stories-vocab-def">Definition</div></span>, and her finger is hurt. Gopi knows he has to help his new friend so he follows the 
<span class="stories-vocab">
	<span class="stories-vocab-word">instructions</span>	<div class="stories-vocab-def">Definition</div></span> his teacher gave him on the first day about what to do when someone gets hurt and 
<span class="stories-vocab">
	<span class="stories-vocab-word">informs</span>	<div class="stories-vocab-def">Definition</div></span> the teacher. The coach 
<span class="stories-vocab">
	<span class="stories-vocab-word">sends</span>	<div class="stories-vocab-def">Definition</div></span> Priya with Gopi to the nurse's office where the nurse gives Priya 
<span class="stories-vocab">
	<span class="stories-vocab-word">first aid</span>	<div class="stories-vocab-def">Definition</div></span>. Priya still doesn't stop crying. To make her feel better, Gopi tells her what his mother 
<span class="stories-vocab">
	<span class="stories-vocab-word">taught</span>	<div class="stories-vocab-def">Definition</div></span> him about being brave and 
<span class="stories-vocab">
	<span class="stories-vocab-word">comforts</span>	<div class="stories-vocab-def">Definition</div></span> her saying she is going to be all right. After that day, Gopi and Priya became the best of friends!
