        "Gopi woke up early in the morning. He knew that breakfast was the most important meal of the day so he did not want to miss it. He prepared some eggs to eat and poured milk to drink. After completing his breakfast, Gopi went outside to play with his friends. The exercise that he got from playing made him hungry again! He came back inside to eat, and since it was already noon, he decided to have his lunch. For lunch, he had rice with a delicious and healthy curry. His friends and him he talked about their day while they ate. After eating Gopi didnâ€™t feel so hungry anymore!"
