<div class="stories-story-paragraph"><span class="stories-story-text">Today Gopi and Priya went to the zoo. First, they saw the tigers. They looked like Priya's pet cat, but much bigger! Tigers love to play in the water. Next Gopi and Priya saw the lions. The two friends could hear their roar from really far away! Next they saw the giraffes, which have really long necks, and the elephants, which were splashing water onto their backs with their trunks to cool off. Watching the monkeys eat bananas made Gopi and Priya really hungry, so the two of them stopped for lunch. Gopi's dad told them when they sat down, “Don’t eat like a pig!” After lunch Gopi and Priya saw the snakes and lizards. Priya tried to stand on one leg while watching the flamingos, but she almost fell over. Flamingos turn pink because they eat a lot of shrimp! Once they finished looking at all of the fish in the aquarium, it was time to go home.</span>
