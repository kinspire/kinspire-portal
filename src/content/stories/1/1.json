        "On the weekends, Gopi likes to visit his cousins who live on a farm. They wake up to the cock-a-doodle-doo of the rooster! Gopi's aunt makes them a big breakfast of fresh eggs from the chickens, and then they go help feed the animals. The sheep are still asleep when they reach their pen, but the pigs are already awake and rolling around in the mud! Once they have finished milking the cows, Gopi and his cousins get to go horseback riding!"
